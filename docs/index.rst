Nettlesome: Simple Semantic Reasoning
======================================

Release v\. |release|.

`Nettlesome <https://github.com/mscarey/nettlesome>`_ is a Python
library defining a limited grammar of natural-language statements
that can be compared automatically for implication or contradiction.

Although Nettlesome was designed to be used for legal annotations in
the `AuthoritySpoke <https://github.com/mscarey/nettlesome>`_ library,
Nettlesome itself doesn't depend on any legal concepts or specialized knowledge.
