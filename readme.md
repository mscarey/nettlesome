Nettlesome is a Python
library defining a limited grammar of natural-language statements
that can be compared programmatically for implication or contradiction.

Nettlesome is intended for use where there is a limited schema of statements
that can be used to annotate a dataset with categories, numbers, quantities,
and dates. One example of such a schema is
the [National Information Exchange Model](https://github.com/NIEM/NIEM-Releases/tree/niem-5.0).

Although Nettlesome was designed to be used for legal annotations in
the [AuthoritySpoke](https://github.com/mscarey/AuthoritySpoke) library,
Nettlesome itself doesn't depend on any legal concepts or specialized knowledge.
