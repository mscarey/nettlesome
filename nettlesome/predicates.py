    A statement about real events or about a legal conclusion.

    Should contain an English-language phrase in the past tense. The past tense
    is used because legal analysis is usually backward-looking,
    determining the legal effect of past acts or past conditions.

    Don't use capitalization or end punctuation to signal the beginning
    or end of the phrase, because the phrase may be used in a
    context where it's only part of a longer sentence.

    Sometimes, a Predicate or Comparison needs to mention two terms that are
    different from each other, but that have interchangeable positions in that
    particular phrase. To convey interchangeability, the template string should
    use identical text for the placeholders for the interchangeable terms,
    except that the different placeholders should each end with a different digit.
