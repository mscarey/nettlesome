        :class:`Entity` would change the meaning of the
        :class:`.Factor` in which the :class:`Entity` is
        embedded.

        Specifies whether the :class:`Entity` object refers to
        more than one thing. Can be checked by a StatementTemplate
        to see whether a verb needs to be made plural.
