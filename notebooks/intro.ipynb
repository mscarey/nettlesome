In Nettlesome the \"subject\" and \"objects\" are simply called \"Terms\", and they should be marked up using the placeholder syntax for Template Strings, which are a part of the Python standard library. Generally speaking, objects that are part of your data model should be designated as Terms, while other nouns that aren't relevant enough to be part of your data model don't need to be terms.\n",
